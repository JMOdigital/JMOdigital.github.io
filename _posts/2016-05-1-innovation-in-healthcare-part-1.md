>  Innovation is in high demand in the healthcare sector, and with good reason. Our new editor **Rahul Gokarn** discusses.

Last week, Harvard Business Review (HBR) posted an article on [Using predictive analytics in patient care](https://hbr.org/2016/04/making-predictive-analytics-a-routine-part-of-patient-care), Bloomberg discussed how [2015 was a record year for health-care deals](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-04-20/2015-was-record-year-for-health-care-deals) and Forbes released two articles on [digital health funding](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/04/13/digital-health-funding-defies-expectations/#35459e147bb5) and [Nokia's move into digital health](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paullamkin/2016/04/26/nokia-moves-into-digital-health-buying-withings-for-e170-million/#77e566044275).

With so much happening in the healthcare sector, particularly in digital health and tech investing, innovation from the private sector is clearly in high demand, and with good reason. 

The evolving challenges faced across the world in terms of ageing population bases, growing demand for access to quality healthcare, and rising costs associated with producing and distributing medications is beginning to shift sources of growth away from traditional sources such as universities and hospitals, towards the private sector, where the majority of innovation is coming from.

For many of us working in healthcare, it is clear that innovations in digital health and technology have the potential to provide massive improvements not only to patient care, but also in improving efficiency and reducing redundancies faced by modern systems and practitioners.

While the need for change is unequivocal, and most, if not all of us have ideas for improvement, it is easy to simply focus on the circadian cycles of working life and neglect the most important aspect of change – implementation. 
Innovation is much more complicated than just having an idea; initiating changes in healthcare can require a great deal of time and commitment, and more often than not, will run into problems such as policy and regulatory issues, especially in large, well established systems like hospitals.


####Approaches to innovation – lessons from the private sector

These problems have led to sluggish progress in the public sector, whereas the bulk of innovation seems to arise from the private sector – but why is this the case?

Perhaps the chief reason for this is the lack of entrepreneurial culture bred into the public healthcare system. The intolerance for failure, lack of funding, and high level of regulation has led many to simply accept the current system. In fact, an article from the HBR archives describes [6 forces that influence innovation in healthcare](https://hbr.org/2006/05/why-innovation-in-health-care-is-so-hard). What is interesting is that these factors are actually not specific to health, but can be applied to a variety of industries and businesses, and this is why there has been such a push towards innovation coming out of the private sector.

Due to these on-going challenges, *'Innovation'* has become the hot topic in healthcare, and has become a mainstay in the majority of health organizations around the world, RPA included. What these organisations understand is that in order to improve their systems, it is important to look for *innovative* solutions/technologies, rather than simply reallocate existing resources.
