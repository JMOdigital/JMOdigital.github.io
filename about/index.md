JMO Digital is a community of clinicians across Australia with a shared interest in digital health, clinical informatics and health entrepreneurship. We are passionate about bringing a *startup philosophy* to the hospital, and seeing technology revolutionise the experience of healthcare for both clinicians and patients. 

This group is open to JMOs, nurses, allied health professionals and technology professionals with a healthcare bent.
